			<h3 style="color:#FFD700" class="mart6">Traction: 6/10</h3>
			<p class="mart6">In this shoe, they use this spiderweb-looking traction pattern and it wasn’t all that impressive going forward. However, when it came to lateral traction, it was amazing.
			You would be completely fine moving side to side however, if you just barely tweak your foot to mostly being forward, you will be sliding on the court.</p>

			<h3 style="color:#FFD700" class="mart6">Cushion Setup: 5/10</h3>
			<p class="mart6">In this shoe, they use the ultra boost as well as the light strike. The light strike acts as a carrier and the boost is in the middle where your foot goes. 
			In the heel, you feel some compression from the boost, and for everywhere else in the foot, you don’t feel it at all. Along with all of this the drop-in protection is very minimal in the shoe.
			With this minimal drop-in protection, the impact protection also dramatically decreases causing the shoe to be stiffer rather than bouncy.</p>

		<article class="mart2">
			<h3 style="color:red" class="mart6">Material: 3/10</h3>
			<p class="mart6">The material in this shoe is horrendous. When you first feel the shoe, the material seems thin, however, when you try to push it in it's just an extremely stiff material. 
			When first using the shoe, my feet were hurting like crazy because the toe box was pinching down onto my foot since the material was so stiff. 
			However, the material does break in a little, and that pinching has gone away, however, it is still relatively stiff. 
			Throughout the rest of the shoe, they just glued and fused down the materials like crazy.
			On the forefront, you have a ton of plastic fused to the shoe that has absolutely no purpose, and then near the ankle, you have some plastic that was just profusely glued together making it extremely stiff.</p>
		</article>
		<article class="mart2">
			<h3 style="color:green" class="mart6">Fit: 7/10</h3>
			<p class="mart6">The fit in this shoe runs long, so you will most likely want to go down half a size. 
			In the toe box, it can get snug, and then for the width, it was pretty normal. </p>
		</article>
		<article class="mart2">
			<h3 style="color:#FFD700" class="mart6">Lockdown: 6/10</h3>
			<p class="mart6">Overall, the lateral containment is extremely good you might say it's overkill. The material is super stiff, and the plastic on the forefront of the shoe makes sure your feet are locked into the shoe. 
			However, the heel locked down is terrible. This happens because the material is super stiff and doesn't want to bend, so your heel kind of slips out of the shoe. 
			The only saving grace on the heel is the Achilles pad because if you didn’t have those your heel would be all over the place, even though it doesn’t help that much. </p>

		<article class="mart2">
			<h3 class="mart6">Overall Rating: 5/10</h3>
			<p class="mart6">Overall, the shoes felt like you were walking in bricks. These shoes were extremely heavy, rigid, clunky, and they just couldn’t break-in. 
			When you ran down the court, the shoes just slapped against the ground. There was almost zero cushion in the shoe and what could be the saving grace of the shoe isn’t one at all. 
			The traction is good in lateral movements, however, once you start moving forward you slide almost every time. 
			Even if you have good traction, that doesn’t matter if your feet can’t stay inside the shoe.</p>
