<title>Krish's Shoe Review</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>Hello and Welcome to my Website. My name is Andrew Krish and I’m just your average college student that loves playing basketball. 
On top of playing basketball, I love shoes and these two passions have brought upon this website of reviewing shoes that I have worn. 
I have worn all of Harden’s signature shoes, however, I don’t remember a ton about 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, I will only be giving you reviews on 4, 5, and 6. 
In the future, I do plan on branching out into Kyrie’s as well as many other notable signature shoes. 
If you have any suggestions on what shoes to try next, I will try my best to do that as soon as possible!</p>
